# password-generator
This script is a very simple generator of difficult passwords, I have not done many checks also because for a program at this level I think they are useless. I hope you like it!

- in a few days I was thinking of adding various options such as the options create passwords only characters or only numbers, although I would have to change everything a bit by adding a class for the characters or just doing an is_number check etc. I will update you in the future!

- if someone comes up with some nice ideas to add, write them to me
